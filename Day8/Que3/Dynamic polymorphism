Que:Explain Dynamic polymorphism?
Ans: 
	Polymorphism is a concept of object oriented programming that allows us to perform a 
	single action in different forms. In this section, we will discuss only the dynamic polumorphism.
	 
	Dynamic polymorphism is a process or mechanism in which a call to an overridden method is to resolve at runtime rather than compile-time. It is also known as runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch. We can achieve dynamic polymorphism by using the method overriding.

In this process, an overridden method is called through a reference variable of a superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
