Que:Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java at class level?
Ans:
	To reduce the complexity and simplicity the language i, multiple inheritance is not supported 
	in java.
	
	Consider a scenario where A,B,and C are three classes. The class inherits A and B classes. If A 
	and B have the same method and you call it from child class object there will be ambuguity to call
	the method of A or B class.
	
	Since compile-time errors are better than runtime error If you inherit 2 classes. So whether you 
	have same method or different there wil be compile time error.
	
	Example:
	
	Class A{
	
		void msg(){
			System.out.println("hello");
		}	
	}
	
	class B{
			void msg(){
				System.out.println("Welcome");
			}
	}
	
	
	Class C extends A,B{
			public static void main(String[] args){
					C obj=new C();
					obj.msg();
			}
	}
